# Genomic Diversity of Hyrcanian Forests

Scripts used to analyze RADseq data for the Hyrcanian forests tree species in northern Iran. De novo SNP calling using STACKS v1.48 from Illumina (150bp) reads and subsequent population genetics analysis like STRUCTURE, demographic history (ANGSD and Stairway Plot 2), and TreeMix. See the manuscript for the details.

Scripts are for the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) version of clusters and can also be used for the Slurm with the adjustments.
